"""Helpers for code that has to run on both Python 2 and Python 3.

Everything in here exists because there is no single spelling that works on
both versions.  Where a common spelling *does* exist - and it usually does -
use it directly instead of adding a helper: a version check at a call site is
a fork of the source in miniature, and this module exists so that there is
exactly one place where such a check lives.

Deliberately has no dependencies outside the standard library, because the
translation toolchain has to keep working during bootstrapping.
